## Goal:

The goal of this project is to design and develop an online Meal Plan Creator that nutritionists can use to generate meal plans and grocery lists for their clients. This app will streamline the process of creating meal plans and make it easier for nutritionists to provide their clients with comprehensive and personalized meal plans.

## Demographic of Users:

The users of this website will be nutritionists and dietitians who are looking for a tool to help them create meal plans and grocery lists for their clients.

## Data:

The data that will be used in this project will include information on food items, recipes, and ingredients. The data will also include nutritional information such as calorie count, macronutrient content, and ingredients list. This data will be used to generate meal plans and grocery lists that are tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each client.

## Approach:

### API:

The API I'll be using to build my project:
https://spoonacular.com/food-api

### Database schema:

The database schema for this project will include tables for ingredients, recipes, and meal plans. The schema will also include a table for users (nutritionists) to store their clients' information and meal plans.

### Issues with API:

One potential issue with the API could be the accuracy and consistency of the nutritional information provided. It is important to ensure that the data being used is up-to-date and reliable.

### Sensitive information:

There may be sensitive information such as user passwords that needs to be securely stored and protected. This information will be encrypted and stored in a database to ensure the privacy and security of clients' information.

### Functionality:

The app will include the following functionality:

- Meal plan generation based on clients' dietary restrictions and preferences
- Grocery list generation based on meal plans
- Recipe suggestions based on ingredients and dietary restrictions
- Option for nutritionists to input custom recipes by providing ingredients

### User Flow:

The user flow for this app will be as follows:

1. Nutritionist creates an account and inputs client information
2. Nutritionist selects client and inputs dietary restrictions and preferences
3. App generates meal plan and grocery list
4. Nutritionist can review and make changes to the meal plan and grocery list
5. Nutritionist can print or download the meal plan and grocery list for their client.

### Features beyond CRUD:

The Meal Plan Creator goes beyond the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality by incorporating advanced features such as meal plan generation, grocery list generation, and recipe suggestions. The app also allows for customization and personalization of meal plans based on clients' dietary restrictions and preferences.

    Stretch Goals:

    1. Integration with grocery delivery services to allow clients to order groceries directly from the app
    2. Option for clients to track their food intake and provide feedback to their nutritionist
    3. Addition of a recipe database that clients can access and use to find new and healthy recipes.
    4. Integration with fitness tracking apps to provide clients with a comprehensive approach to health
    	and wellness.
    5. Payments API to integrate later: https://developer.squareup.com/ca/en?country_redirection=true

    By incorporating these stretch goals, the Meal Plan Creator will provide a comprehensive and convenient
    tool for clients to manage their health and wellness with the help of their nutritionist.

In conclusion, the Meal Plan Creator will provide a simple and efficient tool for nutritionists to create personalized meal plans and grocery lists for their clients. The app will ensure accuracy and security of clients' information while streamlining the meal planning process.
